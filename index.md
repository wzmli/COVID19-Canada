## COVID19 Data

All code is available on [the associated repo](https://github.com/wzmli/COVID19-Canada)

Our [*raw* data set](https://github.com/wzmli/COVID19-Canada/blob/master/COVID19_Canada.csv); [direct download](COVID19_Canada.csv) is compiled from available, open sources on the web â€“ primarily provincial-level public health websites, and news reports. See [README](https://github.com/wzmli/COVID19-Canada/blob/master/README.md) for URLs.

We update once per day. 

This dataset contains daily reported number of positive/negative confirmed cases, presumptive cases, under investigation, and sources. 

New addition: We are adding in Hospitalization, ICU, and Ventilator counts when they are avaliable.

Data before March 14, 2020 were recovered using the [Way Back Machine](https://archive.org/web/); later data are gathered daily directly from the sites. 

## Curating Data

Our [*curated* data set](https://github.com/wzmli/COVID19-Canada/blob/master/git_push/clean.Rout.csv); [direct download](git_push/clean.Rout.csv)

* puts all of the information into a consistent format
* calculates daily new reported cases from cumulative cases
* corrects minor errors (using [this script](clean.R))

When possible we use summary reports from [the federal outbreak website](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection.html) to check our error correction
